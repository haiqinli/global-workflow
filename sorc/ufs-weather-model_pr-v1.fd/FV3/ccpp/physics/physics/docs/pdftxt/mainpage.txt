/**
\mainpage Introduction 

Welcome to the scientific documentation for the parameterizations and suites available in the Common 
Community Physics Package (CCPP) v4.  

The CCPP-Physics is envisioned to contain parameterizations used in NOAA's Unified Forecast System (UFS) 
applications for weather through seasonal prediction timescales, encompassing operational schemes as well as 
developmental schemes under consideration for upcoming 
operational implementations. This version contains all parameterizations of the current operational GFS,
plus additional developmental schemes. There are four suites supported for use with the Single Column Model (SCM) 
developed by the Development Testbed Center (GFS_v15p2, GFS_v16beta, GSD_v1, and csawmg), and two suites
supported for use with the atmospheric component of the UFS (i.e., GFS_v15p2 and GFS_v16beta).

In this website you will find documentation on various aspects of each 
parameterization, including a high-level overview of its function, the input/output argument list, 
and a description of the algorithm. 
The latest CCPP public release is Version 4.0 (January 2019), and more details on it may be found on the
<a href="https://dtcenter.org/community-code/common-community-physics-package-ccpp"> CCPP website </a> hosted by
the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC).
